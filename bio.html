		<title>Leah Stern - Biography</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<p>Leah Stern is a sophomore at Tufts University. She does not enjoy talking about herself so writing biographies is difficult. For example, this biography is terrible and might be her worst yet. The fact that this biography is terrible describes her pretty well. She hopes not many people read it.</p>
