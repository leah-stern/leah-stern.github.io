Implementation:
I (hopefully) implemented the homework correctly. I used an html file with
its own css file for each of the three websites and all files can be found
in my github.io repository. 

Collaboration:
I collaborated with Iris Oliver, another current Comp20 student, to set up 
our git ub.io repositories.

Hours Spent:
I spent approximately 6 hours completing this assignment.
