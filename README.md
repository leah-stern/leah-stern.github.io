Comp20: HW1

Implementation:
I (hopefully) implemented the homework correctly. I used an html file with
its own css file for each of the three websites and all files can be found
in my github.io repository. My index.html site redirects to my github.io
page and the index.html page on my Tufts CS accounts redirects to my
github.io website as well. 

However, the W3 validator says I have stray end head and body tags in all of
my html files. I'm having trouble fixing these errors because the tags have
matching head and body opening tags, so I am unsure as to why they are 
"stray".

Collaboration:
I collaborated with Iris Oliver, another current Comp20 student, to set up 
our git ub.io repositories.

Hours Spent:
I spent approximately 6 hours completing this assignment.
